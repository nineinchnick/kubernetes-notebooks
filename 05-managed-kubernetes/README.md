Managed Kubernetes
==================

After finishing this notebook, you'll learn:
* What is EKS and how is it different from `kind`
* How to create, update and delete an EKS cluster using the web console and `eksctl`

## Overview

[Amazon EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
describes how to use EKS both via the web console and the `eksctl` command.

## Excercise

Create an EKS cluster using the web console. Configure your local `kubectl` command
and deploy an application to the cluster.

Repeat this but use the `eksctl` command.
