What is Kubernetes
==================

The official documentation starts with this question - [What is Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/).
But it might be easier to grasp it after seeing the [Kubernetes Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/) it consists of.
But if all of this is already overwhelming, don't worry, it's not required to know all of this to do the following excercise.

First excercise is creating a Kubernetes cluster. You can either do this:
* using `minikube`, [in your web broswer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-interactive/)
* or using `kind` locally, on your laptop

* [install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
* [install kind](hhttps://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)

TODO create a kind cluster
TODO look around - see which cluster we're talking to, list namespaces, pods in a namespace, watch events, delete a pod and see it being recreated
TODO delete the cluster, recreate it
