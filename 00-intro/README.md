Intro
=====

After finishing this course, you should be able to:
* deploy applications on Kubernetes
* debug issues with deploying applications
* automate deployments

The whole course consists of several notebooks, each aimed to be completed under 45 minutes.

These notebooks will contain mostly excercises and will often
reference [the official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
to avoid repeating it. When going through a notebook, students
are expected to follow a reference, read it, go back to the notebook
and note down one or more important highlights from it, if needed.

The notebooks are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
and stored in a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository. Start with creating
[a clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) of this repository.

> Note: if you're reading this on GitHub, read how to
> create [a fork or GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo),
> or [a fork on Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html).
> For other hosted Git solutions, look for its documentation to learn how to work with a repository fork.

This is where you should start taking notes. Use the code block below
to write down the actions you had to take to create a clone or fork, if using
a web browser, or commands, if using a command line client.

```
Example of how to create a fork:
* click the "fork" button in the top right corner when reading this file
```

```bash
# example of using the GitHub command line interface client to create a fork
gh fork nineinchnick/kubernetes-notebooks
```

Now commit your notes. If you've created a fork, push the commits to it.
