Summary of what you should learn from this notebook:
* these bullet points are not ordered
* because they're all equally important

## Overview

Here comes a brief introduction to the subject. It should mostly contain
[references](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/reference)
to external documentation explaining this in much greater detail, to avoid
copying this knowledge, and establishing
[a single source of truth](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/documentation/building-a-single-source-of-truth-ssot-for-your-team).

> Note: avoid linking to Wikipedia, because
> [it is not a reliable source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_reliable_source).

## Excercise

Copy this template as a `README.md` file in a new directory, and edit it, replacing
all contents, but retaining a similar structure.

## Test

This section contains a few open questions to verify the knowledge gained.
These are ordered, so it's easier to reference them when discussing with a teacher or colleagues.

1. What's a reference?
1. Why having a single source of truth is beneficial?
1. What steps did you take to copy a file into a new directory?

## Extras

For eager students, that finished the notebook quickly, this section could contain
a modification of the excercise requiring more creativity or purposely set traps,
mimicking real-life issues one can run into.
